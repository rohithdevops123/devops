Binary filtering

 The plugin will prevent binary files filtering without adding some <<<excludes>>> configuration
 for the following file extensions <<<jpg>>>, <<<jpeg>>>, <<<gif>>>, <<<bmp>>> and <<<png>>>.
 
 If you like to add supplemental file extensions this can simply achieved by
 using a configuration like the following:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
          <nonFilteredFileExtensions>
            <nonFilteredFileExtension>pdf</nonFilteredFileExtension>
            <nonFilteredFileExtension>swf</nonFilteredFileExtension>
          </nonFilteredFileExtensions>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
